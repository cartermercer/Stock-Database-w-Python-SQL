This repository contains some of the basic frameworks to collect data from industry standard stock APIs, IEX and Alpha Vantage, and 
upload that data to a MySQL database. Using Python scripts with SQL incorporated and powerful libraries like requests, mysql, and pandas can accomplish this.
There are a few Python scripts uploaded to show this process. They target ways of getting started with your symbols, then getting generic information about a stock, and then how one would efficiently get daily, and monthly stock data into the database.
